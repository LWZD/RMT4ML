# RMT4ML
This repository contains [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) for visualizing random matrix theory results and their applications to large dimensional machine learning problems.

In each subfolder (named after the corresponding section number) there are:
* a HTML file containing the MATLAB demos in the section
* some .m functions containing the (improved) algorithms in the section
